# PFN Redesign - Project Roadmap & Development Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for rebuilding the PFN press on nail e-commerce website using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **State Management**: Hybrid approach combining React Context API for simplicity with Redux-like patterns (actions, reducers) for structure and future scalability
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **CSS Framework**: TBD

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning (Week 1)
- [ ] Create ERD diagrams and database schema
- [x] Design wireframes for key user flows
- [x] Create component hierarchy
- [ ] Initialize React project structure
- [ ] Set up Spring Boot application
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL database connection
- [ ] Set up Git repository with branching strategy
- [ ] Initialize CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy minimal application to hosting environment

**Deliverables:**
- Project repository setup
- Database schema
- Component architecture document
- Deployed basic application

### Phase 2: Authentication System Implementation (Week 2)
- [ ] Create user registration endpoint and forms
- [ ] Implement login functionality
- [ ] Set up JWT token management
- [ ] Build protected routes
- [ ] Create navigation bar with auth status
- [ ] Implement form validation

- [ ] Implement image gallery for products
- [ ] Add category navigation

**Deliverables:**
- User profile management
- Product catalog with filtering
- Individual product pages
- Category navigation

### Phase 4: Shopping Cart & Product Management (Week 4)
- [ ] Implement product editing functionality
- [ ] Add product deletion with safeguards
- [ ] Create shopping cart data model
- [ ] Build cart state management
- [ ] Implement add/remove/update cart functionality
- [ ] Create cart summary components
- [ ] Add persistent cart (saved to database)

**Deliverables:**
- Product management features
- Functional shopping cart
- Cart persistence between sessions

### Phase 5: Checkout & Final Polish (Week 5)
- [ ] Create checkout flow
- [ ] Implement order summary page
- [ ] Build simulated payment processing
- [ ] Create order confirmation process
- [ ] Add order history to user profile
- [ ] Implement responsive design adjustments
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

**Deliverables:**
- Complete checkout flow
- Order management system
- Fully responsive design
- Production-ready application

## Future Enhancements (Post-Project)
These features are planned for future development after the core project is complete:

### Enhanced Content Features
- [ ] Video integration on homepage
- [ ] "Trending" product components
- [ ] Theme-based product collections
- [ ] Seasonal product recommendations
- [ ] Social media content integration

### Advanced E-commerce Features
- [ ] Waitlist functionality
- [ ] Product recommendation engine
- [ ] User reviews and ratings
- [ ] Advanced filtering by nail shape/length

### Technical Enhancements
- [ ] Performance optimization for video content
- [ ] Enhanced security features
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] A/B testing framework

## Development Standards

### Code Style
- Use Java conventions for Spring Boot
- Document all components and API endpoints

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical components
- API integration tests
- Manual testing for user flows

### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`

### Performance Targets
- Initial page load < 2s
- Time to Interactive < 3s
- API response times < 300ms

## Project Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- React Router for navigation
- Axios for API calls
- React Context for state management
- Form validation library (to be determined)

### Backend Dependencies
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Security
- PostgreSQL connector
- JWT authentication library
- Lombok for reducing boilerplate

## Milestones and Timeline

# AR Nail Try-On Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This document will outline the technical strategy for implementing the Augmented Reality (AR) nail try-on functionality for the PFN e-commerce platform. The approach follows a risk-mitigated, incremental development strategy that progresses from simple image overlays to sophisticated 3D nail modeling.

## Strategic Approach: 3-Phase Development

### Why This Approach?

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Each phase delivers functional value while reducing technical complexity
2. **Learning-Driven**: Each phase informs optimizations for the next
3. **User Feedback Integration**: Early user testing shapes advanced features
4. **Performance Optimization**: Gradual complexity increase allows for performance tuning

## Phase 1: Static Image Overlay System (MVP)

### Objective
Establish the foundational AR pipeline with basic hand detection and static nail design overlays.

### Technical Implementation

#### Hand Detection Setup
```javascript
// [TODO]: Example of MediaPipe Hands Integration

```

#### Basic Overlay System
- **Static PNG images** of nail designs with transparency
- **Simple positioning** based on fingertip landmarks
- **2D transformations** (scale, rotate, translate) for basic fitting
- **Canvas-based rendering** for performance

### Deliverables
- [] Hand landmark detection working reliably
- [] Static nail images overlaying on fingertips
- [] Basic UI for design selection
- [] Photo capture functionality
- [] Performance benchmarking (>30 FPS on mobile)

### Technical Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Hand detection accuracy | Start with higher confidence thresholds | Prioritize reliability over detection range |
| Mobile performance | Use Canvas API over WebGL initially | Simpler implementation, broader compatibility |
| Image scaling | Pre-calculate nail dimensions | Avoid real-time calculations |

## Phase 2: Real-Time Hand Tracking with Dynamic Positioning

### Objective
Implement sophisticated hand tracking with dynamic nail positioning that adapts to hand movement and finger angles.

### Advanced Hand Tracking

#### 3D Hand Pose Estimation
```javascript
// [TODO]: Example of code to calculate hand positioning

```

#### Dynamic Positioning Features
- **Finger width detection** for automatic nail scaling
- **3D rotation calculation** for realistic nail orientation
- **Perspective correction** when fingers are angled toward camera
- **Multi-finger tracking** with individual design support
- **Smooth interpolation** to reduce jittery movement

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Gesture recognition** for UI interaction (pinch to zoom, swipe to change designs)
- **Hand positioning feedback** to guide users for optimal tracking
- **Real-time design switching** without tracking loss
- **Lighting adaptation** for different environments

### Performance Optimizations
- **Optimized MediaPipe configuration** based on Phase 1 learnings
- **Frame rate adaptation** based on device capabilities
- **Background processing** for computationally expensive operations
- **Memory management** for continuous AR sessions

## Phase 3: 3D Nail Models with Realistic Rendering

### Objective
Replace static images with 3D nail models that provide realistic lighting, shadows, and depth perception.

### 3D Modeling Architecture

#### Three.js Integration
```javascript
// [TODO]: Example of Three.js integration
```

#### 3D Model Pipeline
1. **Base Nail Geometry**: Parametric nail shape generation
2. **Design Textures**: High-resolution texture mapping
3. **Material Properties**: Realistic nail surface (glossy, translucent)
4. **Dynamic Lighting**: Environment-responsive lighting
5. **Shadow Casting**: Realistic shadows on hand

### Advanced Rendering Features

#### Realistic Material Properties
- **Subsurface Scattering**: For translucent nail appearance
- **Specular Reflection**: For glossy nail surfaces
- **Normal Mapping**: For textured designs (glitter, patterns)
- **Environment Mapping**: Reflections of surrounding environment

#### Physical Simulation
- **Nail Curvature**: Realistic curved nail surface
- **Finger Deformation**: Nail adaptation to finger shape
- **Collision Detection**: Prevent nail intersection with fingers
- **Physics-Based Animation**: Natural movement and settling

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Model Generation
```javascript
// [TODO]: Example code of press-on model generation

```

#### Lighting System
- **Dynamic Light Positioning**: Light follows hand movement
- **Shadow Mapping**: Real-time shadow generation
- **HDR Environment**: High dynamic range lighting
- **Color Temperature Adaptation**: Adjust for different lighting conditions

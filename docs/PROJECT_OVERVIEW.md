## Project Vision

**Problem Statement**: Traditional e-commerce for press-on nails relies on static product images, leading to uncertainty about fit, style, and color matching. This results in customer hesitation and potentially higher return rates.

**Solution**: An immersive AR experience that allows customers to virtually "try on" nail designs using their smartphone camera, seeing realistic renderings on their actual hands in real-time.

**Unique Value Proposition**: The AR solution specifically designed for press-on nail visualization, combining advanced hand tracking with 3D nail modeling.

## Technical Innovation Highlights

### AR Try-On Feature (Primary Innovation)
- **Phase 1**: Static image overlay system for rapid prototyping
- **Phase 2**: Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe Hands
- **Phase 3**: 3D nail models with realistic lighting and physics
- **Technology Stack**: MediaPipe, Three.js, WebGL, Canvas API

### Modern Full-Stack Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, modern hooks-based architecture
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 17, RESTful API design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized schema for AR assets
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security with Spring Security

### Mobile-First Design
- Responsive design optimized for mobile AR experiences
- Progressive Web App capabilities for app-like performance
- Touch-optimized UI for seamless nail design selection

## Market Opportunity

**Target Market**: Women aged 18–40; especially Gen Z and Millennials, in both middle and high-income brackets. These groups spend more on nail services and seek convenient, trend-forward, and personalized options. Press-on nails are most popular among style-driven, price, and time-conscious groups, making AR try-on tools highly attractive to them.

**Market Size**: $1.08B projected press-on nail market by 2030 with 6.5% annual growth [3](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/press-on-nails-market-report)

**Competitive Advantage**: No current platform offers AR try-on for press-on nails, meeting the needs of shoppers who alternate between salon and DIY experiences.

## Development Methodology

### Agile Approach
- **Phase-based development** with incremental AR feature complexity
- **MVP-first strategy** focusing on core e-commerce functionality
- **User-centric design** with wireframes and user flow validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Progressive AR implementation** reducing technical risk
- **Fallback UI** for devices without AR capability
- **Performance optimization** for mobile devices

## Technical Achievements

### Backend Architecture
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with DTOs, services, and repositories  
- **Security Implementation**: JWT authentication, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries, proper indexing, data normalization

### Frontend Excellence
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components with proper prop interfaces
- **State Management**: React Context + React Query for optimal performance
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, and AR functionality testing

### AR Innovation
- **Research-Driven Development**: Comprehensive analysis of AR libraries and approaches

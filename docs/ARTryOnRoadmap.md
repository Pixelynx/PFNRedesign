## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Basic AR

**Frontend Foundation:**
- Set up React components for camera access and basic AR overlay
- Implement hand detection using MediaPipe Hands
- Create basic nail overlay rendering system

**Backend Foundation:**
- Design database schema for nail designs, user sessions
- Create REST APIs for design catalog and user data
- Set up image storage system

**Database Schema (MVP):**
- Users table
- NailDesigns table (id, name, image_url, category)
- UserSavedLooks table (user_id, design_configuration)*

## Phase 2: Basic Try-On Experience

**AR Implementation:**
- Hand landmark detection and finger identification
- Basic nail overlay positioning system
- Simple design application (solid colors only)
- Real-time rendering optimization

**Design Management:**
- Static design catalog with basic categories
- Design selection and application to all fingers
- Simple image preloading system

**Tools:** Three.js or raw Canvas for 3D positioning, React state management

## Phase 3: User Features & Persistence

**User System:**
- Basic user authentication (email/password)
- Save/load favorite looks functionality

**Enhanced Try-On:**
- Individual finger design selection
- Basic hand positioning guidance
- Photo capture functionality

**Backend APIs:**
- User authentication endpoints
- CRUD operations for saved looks
- Design catalog management

**Tools:** Spring Security, JWT tokens, React Context + React Query for auth state

## Phase 4: Polish & Optimization

**Performance:**
- AR tracking optimization
- Image caching and lazy loading
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

**UX Enhancements:**
- Loading states and error handling
- Basic onboarding flow
- Improved hand positioning feedback

## Technology Stack Recommendations:

**Frontend AR Libraries:**
- MediaPipe Hands

**3D Rendering:**
- Three.js OR
- Canvas API

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS S3
- CloudFront
- Docker
- Nginx
